Notes
I tried to get XML validation to work but it did not work so validation is done in the class This is on github at https://github.com/chris-l-weber/jive if you wish to look at my commits the local git repo is also in this sourcecode zip file 

Extras
If I took more time I think most the work would be on the front end things like alternating colors on the tables, pagination, sorting. for the backend I would implement the remaining CRUD functions, make it so it works as an API call for use in a AJAX/JS/mobile front end, or similar.
