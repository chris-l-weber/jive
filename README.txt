to initialize the database need to run the 4-21-2014.sql file to add the table 
(ex: mysql -u root clwtest < 4-21-2014.sql )

CONST.java  may need the connectionstring changed as it is currently and is used to 
in Add.java and Const.java 
jdbc:mysql://localhost/clwtest?user=root

Notes
I tired to get XML validation to work but it did not work so validation is done in the class
This is on github at https://github.com/chris-l-weber/jive if you wish to look at my commits 
the local git repo is also in this sourcecode zip file
